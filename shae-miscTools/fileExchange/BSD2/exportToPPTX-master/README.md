## Overview

exportToPPTX allows user to create PowerPoint 2007+ (PPTX) files without using COM-objects automation (or PowerPoint application itself). Proper XML files are created and packaged into PPTX file that can be read and displayed by PowerPoint.

*Note about PowerPoint 2003 and older:* To open these PPTX files in older PowerPoint software you will need to get a free office compatibility pack from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3

```matlab
exportToPPTX('command',parameters,...)

    * center - centered text
    * right - right-aligned text
* `VerticalAlignment` Vertical alignment of text:
    * top - top-aligned text (default)

    * bottom - bottom-aligned text
* `LineWidth` Width of the textbox's edge line, a single value (in points). Edge is not drawn by default. Unless either LineWidth or EdgeColor are specified. 
* `EdgeColor` Color of the textbox's edge, a three element vector specifying RGB value. Edge is not drawn by default. Unless either LineWidth or EdgeColor are specified. 

```matlab
exportToPPTX('addnote',noteText)
```

Adds notes information to the current slide. Requires text of the notes to be added. This command does not return any values. Note: repeat calls overwrite previous information.

```matlab
exportToPPTX('save',filename)
```

Saves current presentation. If PowerPoint was created with 'new' command, then filename to save to is required. If PowerPoint was openned, then by default it will write changes back to the same file. If another filename is provided, then changes will be written to the new file (effectively a 'Save As' operation). Returns full name of the presentation file written.

```matlab
exportToPPTX('close')
```

Cleans temporary files and closes current presentation. No additional inputs required. No outputs.

```matlab
exportToPPTX('saveandclose')
```

Shortcut to save and close at the same time. No additional inputs required. No outputs.

```matlab
exportToPPTX('query')
```

Returns current status either to the command window (if no output arguments) or to the output variable. If no presentation is currently open, returned value is null.

## Example

Here is a very simple example

```matlab
% Start new presentation
exportToPPTX('new','Dimensions',[6 6]);

% Just an example image
load mandrill; figure('color','w'); image(X); colormap(map); axis off; axis image;

% Add slide, then add image to it, then add box
exportToPPTX('addslide');
exportToPPTX('addpicture',gcf,'Scale','maxfixed');
exportToPPTX('addtext','Mandrill','Position',[0 5 6 1],'FontWeight','bold','HorizontalAlignment','center','VerticalAlignment','bottom');

% Save and close
exportToPPTX('save','example.pptx');
exportToPPTX('close');
```

A more elaborate example is included in the `examples_exportToPPTX.m` file.
